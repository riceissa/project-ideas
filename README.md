# Project ideas

Project ideas for Issa Rice (see repo issues)

Each issue is a project idea, and should have exactly one effort tag, probably one venue tag, and at least one format tag.

Most of the ideas are for me to work on eventually, but others can work on them as well (in fact, I would prefer that since it means less work for me). Others can also add new ideas to this repo for me to work on (simlar to [requested answers or "ask to answer" on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Request-Answers-and-how-does-it-work/answers/11143418)).
