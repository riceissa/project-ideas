# Project ideas

Project ideas for Issa Rice (see repo issues)

Each issue is a project idea, and should have exactly one effort label, probably one venue label, and at least one format label. (It looks like only repo contributors can edit labels, so you can just explain this in the issue itself.)

Most of the ideas are for me to work on eventually, but others can work on them as well (in fact, I would prefer that since it means less work for me). Others can also add new ideas to this repo for me to work on (similar to [requested answers or "ask to answer" on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Request-Answers-and-how-does-it-work/answers/11143418)). In an ideal world, we would all have repos like this one and we could ask each other for specific kinds of output (and the votes would help us decide what to prioritize).
